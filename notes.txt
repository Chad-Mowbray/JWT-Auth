Create a lesson about JWT

Use a public/private cert  

hide private cert, make pub available

(add the lesson with example code Bob and Alice) (fakeSHA)

Have a server, with two endpoints: public and private

Have user log in
issue user a signed JWT
If JWT valid, grant access


Show how modifying a single character in the token invalidates it (show a bad attempt at stealing a token)


More Modules:
Add a seperate module on analysis tools (ZAP, Wireshark, etc)
Docker
Webgoat
